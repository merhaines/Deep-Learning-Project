**Sea Ice Prediction Network** <br />
Annabel Flatland and Meredith Haines <br />

This project proposes a sea ice prediction network based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that performs binary classification on ice concentration data to forecast sea ice locations in the Arctic. The network is trained on historical sea ice data and satellite imagery to learn the spatial and temporal patterns of sea ice movement and concentration. <br />

The resulting model is capable of accurately predicting the presence or absence of sea ice in specific locations, which can aid in weather forecasting, climate modeling, and resource management. We evaluate the performance of our proposed network using a dataset of sea ice concentration data and demonstrate its ability to predict sea ice locations with high accuracy. Our findings suggest that CNN-based approaches have the potential to significantly improve sea ice prediction capabilities and contribute to better understanding and management of the Arctic environment.
